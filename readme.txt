== Description ==

Simple FAQ is a lightweight plugin which adds FAQs to your WordPress site. Create questions easily via the dashboard and then display them via shortcode as a basic list or accordion. You have control over the output, including ordering, categorisation and styling. Let the theme inform the appearance of your FAQs so that they blend in seamlessly, or use one of the built in accordion skins.

* Specify post ordering via shortcode
* Use multiple shortcodes per page
* Can be styled by your theme or by selecting a separate accordion skin
* Includes a basic shortcode to pull through a plain list, ready for styling by a developer
